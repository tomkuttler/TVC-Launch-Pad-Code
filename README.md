This repository contains the source code for a launch pad specifically designed for model rockets with thrust vector control. The launch pad has the ability to detect a radio signal from a remote control, which triggers a 30-second countdown. It also includes various safety features such as stabilizers, strongback support, and clamp retraction to ensure a safe launch.
